# The Anatomy of a Playlist
__Team Members__: Daisy Abbott, Hannah Guo, Amy Zhong

The Anatomy of a Playlist tutorial aims to equip users (you!) with the skills to generate creative data visualizations, culminating in a personalized playlist cover "artwork" based on the mood of their own playlist. Through this tutorial, users will learn to fetch, analyze, and visualize their playlist data using the Spotify Web API. This API allows us to access extensive information on playlists and tracks; it contains especially rich metadata on individual tracks, such as their mood (valence) and tempo. Our tutorial will demonstrate how to generate artistic visualizations based on these scores. In addition to gaining familiarity working with APIs, users will work with the pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries â€” essential tools for data analysis and visualization. By the completion of this tutorial, users will have a deeper understanding of the Spotify API as well as the ability to visually interpret and present their playlist data in an interesting and artistic way. This tutorial will be friendly to developers of all skill levels and will primarily serve users who are curious about the Spotify API; interested in learning about pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn; or who want to find further ways to express themselves and their music.
